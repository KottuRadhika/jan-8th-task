While AJIO shall make reasonable endeavors to ensure that the User’s Personal Information and the Financial Information is duly protected by undertaking security measures prescribed under applicable laws, the User is strongly advised to exercise discretion while providing Personal Information or Financial Information while using the Services given that the Internet is susceptible to security breaches.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;margin-right: 40px;">5.7. Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User visits the Website, AJIO automatically receives the uniform resource locator of the site from which such User visits the Website, details of the website such User is visiting on leaving the Website, the internet protocol (“IP”) address of each User’s computer operating system, type of web browser the User is using, email patterns, and the name of the User’s internet service provider. This information is used solely to analyze overall User trends and to help AJIO in improving its Services. Please note that the link between the User’s IP address and the User’s personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without such User’s permission or except when required by law or to provide or facilitate the User with the Services. Notwithstanding the above, the User acknowledges AJIO’s right to share some of the aggregate findings, including the Personal Information provided by the Users in an unidentifiable form, and not the specific data with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners, and others in order to help grow the business.The amount of information sent to AJIO depends on the settings of the web browser used by the User to access the Platforms. The User may refer to the browser used, if the User wishes to learn what information is provided to AJIO.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;margin-right: 40px;">5.8. The Website and the Mobile Applications use temporary cookies to store certain data.

            <p style="margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;margin-right: 40px;">5.9. A User may set or amend his/her/its web browsers to delete or disable cookies. If a User chooses to disable cookies on his/her/its computer or mobile telecommunication device, it may impair, degrade or restrict access to certain areas of the Websites or the Mobile Applications. Merely closing the web browser should ordinarily clear all temporary cookies installed by AJIO. However, Users are encouraged to use the “clear cookies” functionality of their browsers to ensure deletion, as AJIO cannot guarantee, predict or provide for the behavior of the equipment of all the Users of the Website or the Mobile Applications, as the case may be.</p>

In the course of serving advertisements or optimising the Services to its Users, AJIO may allow authorised third parties to place or recognise a unique cookie on the User’s browser.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;margin-right: 40px;">5.11. AJIO does not exercise control over the websites displayed as search results or links from within the Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on the Users’ computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information or Financial Information from the Users, for which AJIO shall not be held responsible or liable. AJIO does not make any representations concerning the privacy practices or policies of such third parties or terms of use of such websites, nor does AJIO guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of the information, data, text, software, sound, photographs, graphics, videos, messages or other materials available on such websites. The inclusion or exclusion does not imply any endorsement by AJIO of such websites, the websites’ provider, or the information on the website.</p>

These surveys and contests are optional and if the User chooses to respond, his/her/its responses will be kept anonymous. The demographic information that the User provides while availing or signing-up for the Services and through any surveys or contests is used to help AJIO improve its services to meet the needs and preferences of Users.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;margin-right: 40px;">5.15. AJIO does not knowingly collect personal data from children (only persons above the aged of 18 shall be permitted to use the Services as provided in the Terms of Use). In an event, where in contravention of the Terms of Use, a person below the age of 18 uses the Services, AJIO shall not be held liable or responsible for any damage or injury suffered by such person in logging into the Website or the Mobile Application and making use of the Services.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;margin-right: 40px;">5.16. AJIO has implemented security policies, rules and technical measures, as required under applicable law including firewalls, transport layer security and other physical and electronic security measures to protect the Financial Information and Personal Information that it has under its control from unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification and unlawful destruction or accidental loss. It is expressly stated that AJIO shall not be responsible for any breach of security or for any action of any third parties that receive Users’ personal data or events that are beyond the reasonable control of AJIO including, acts of government, computer hacking, unauthorised access to computer data and storage device, computer crashes, breach of security and encryption, etc.</p>
